# Earthquake_Detection_Using_Arduino
This project implements a real-time earthquake detection system using an Arduino microcontroller. It utilizes sensors such as accelerometers or vibration sensors to monitor ground movements and detect seismic activities. The system processes sensor data to identify earthquake signals and triggers alerts when significant tremors are detected.
